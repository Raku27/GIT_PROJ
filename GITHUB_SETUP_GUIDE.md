# GitHub Setup Guide - Step by Step

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `GIT_PROJ` (or any name you prefer)
3. Description: "Portfolio showcasing engineering projects: Data Analysis, Matching Algorithms, Engineering Pipelines, and AI/ML"
4. Visibility: **Public** (recommended for portfolio to share with recruiters)
5. **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT check any of these boxes:
   - ❌ Add a README file
   - ❌ Add .gitignore
   - ❌ Choose a license
   
   (We already have all of these!)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Copy the Repository URL

After creating, GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions. Copy the HTTPS URL which will look like:
`https://github.com/Raku27/GIT_PROJ.git`

## Step 3: Connect Local Repository

Once you've created the repository, we'll run these commands to connect and push.
